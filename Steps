create models:
    - create base class for all models
    - create all the entities/models based on the class diagrams

Controllers:
    - Generating the ticket is the primary step in the process of parking, hence we'll start with the ticket model's controller
    - For generating a ticket we need Vehicle, Entry time, Operator, Gate. But does client needs to provide all this to us?
      No. If client provides us with just the vehicle number and the gate number we can fetch details related to it from the database.
      Problems with directly involving Models in the Controller API's :-
        1. If we add/remove models from the input, current clients will start failing.
        2. We should not expose the Model details to client because of privacy.
      Now's where the concept of DTO comes into picture. DTO is a data transfer object which is used to transfer data from client to underlying systems.
      It is a wrapper for the data on which we will work in the backend but ask for only those data to our client of which he has knowledge about.

Services:
    - We'll create a service for ticket generation in the controller.
        Create skeleton/Flow in the service then implement it:
            1. Get vehicle from DB using vehicleNumber, if Vehicle is not found, register vehicle in the DB.
            2. Assign a parking spot to the vehicle
            3. Update status of the parking spot
            4. Create a ticket
            5. Save ticket in the DB

    - Always remember: controller (waiter) -> service (chef) -> repository (kitchen) -> DB(food)
    - Implement the concept of object containers (spring internally uses this concept)
